  "body": "### Welcome to Spectra.jl\r\nSpectra.jl is a package aimed at helping spectroscopic (Raman, Infrared, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, XAS...) data treatment under the Julia language (http://julialang.org/).\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nSpectra.jl provides several functions that allow streamlining the treatment of spectra: baseline subtraction, smoothing, splines, normalisation... Furthermore, combined with JuMP and the optimisation packages in Julia (http://www.juliaopt.org/), it provides a robust yet flexible optimisation experience in order to perform various tasks such as for instance peak fitting. It is totally free, you can code using JuliaBox (https://www.juliabox.org/) such that you have nothing to install on your computer, and you can enjoy the help of an active community.\r\n\r\n## Wiki\r\nA wiki is directly available on Github: https://github.com/charlesll/Spectra.jl/wiki\r\n\r\nDocs will be integrated directly in Spectra.jl soon, however for now they will be drafted in the Github wiki for saving time and providing them as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nPrincipal author and creator is Charles LE LOSQ (@charlesll), research fellow at the Research School of Earth Sciences. Any contributions welcome!\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\ncharles.lelosq@anu.edu.au\r\n",
