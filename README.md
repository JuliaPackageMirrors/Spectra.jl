This is a collection of functions in Julia to treat IR/Raman/XANES spectra.

It is particularly focused on large datasets because of the high speed of Julia's, for performing peak fitting along Infrared diffusion profiles for instance.

It has access to excellent optimisation algorithms too, and the JuMP interface combined with Ipopt offers a very robust and usefull modelling package.

Examples will be included as notebooks.

Package under construction, any help welcome!
