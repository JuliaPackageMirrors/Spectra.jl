Before Starting
***************

Using Julia and Spectra.jl for processing your data is quite similar to Matlab, with the flexibility offered by the open-source and free character of Julia. Reading the docs is strongly recommended. A good start will be to read the docs of Julia itself:

http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.4/

Programming can be done locally using your browser and the IJulia notebooks, very similar to the IPython ones. Please follow the instructions there to do so:

https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl

For a Matlab-like interface, you can use Atom with Juno. Follow all the instructions at this link to install this interactive developing environment:

For maintaining your packages up-to-date, something critical with the fast evolution of Julia packages, I suggest running each day of Julia use the update command:

    Pkg.update()

For further information about installing packages, please have a read at:

http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.4/manual/packages/

Any help developing and maintaining this Spectra.jl package is welcome. You can fork the project on GitHub, modify it and commit your modifications. You can also add requests and everything on Github. Please do not hesitate to do so! The functionalities available in Spectra.jl are not exhaustive, and a little help to add new ones will be more that welcome.
