 Installation

Two ways of using Spectra.jl: [1] with using a cloud-computing approach and [2] with installing everything on your computer.

[1] JuliaBox (https://www.juliabox.org/) allows you to run Julia in your browser. You still need to add Spectra.jl. To do so, run a notebook, and in the first instance, type

    Pkg.add("Spectra.jl")

Everything shoul install without trouble. Requirements in Spectra.jl are extensive and will provide you all the packages needed by Spectra.jl's functions and examples.

[2] You can download the current version of Julia and follow the installation instruction here: http://julialang.org/downloads/ . Then, run

    Pkg.add("Spectra.jl")

You can start Julia, type for instance

   using("IJulia")
   notebook()

And it will start Jupyler in your browser. From there, you can create new notebooks, open old ones, etc.

With this simple installation, you should be ready to go! Do not forget to go through the instructions and documentation of Julia. The following sites are very helpful:

http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.4/

Particularly, the section about packages is important to read, with a mandatory look at the paragraphs 'Adding or Removing Packages' and 'Updating Packages':

http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.4/manual/packages/

Maintaining the distribution is easy, it takes only a

    Pkg.update()

I suggest doing that each day you are running Julia, as everything is in constant evolution for this package. Another good read is the page for IJulia if you plan using it:

https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl

Concerning a nice interface, other than IJulia, we can suggest using Atom with Juno. Follow all the instructions there to install and run such matlab-like interactive developping environment:
