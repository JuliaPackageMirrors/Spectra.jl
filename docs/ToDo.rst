To Do

Tutorials are available in the examples folder of Spectra.jl (https://github.com/charlesll/Spectra.jl/tree/master/examples) and include notebooks showing how to fit peaks in a Raman spectrum of a glass after subtraction of a baseline. Another example shows how to use Spectra.jl to peak-fit Infrared spectra taken along a diffusion profile in a crystal. Further examples will be added in a very soon future! 

--------------
Pre-Processing
--------------

- Adding access to the SMOOTH spline library, used by the csaps Matlab function.

-------------
Integration
-------------

- gaussianarea will change in peakarea, with the option to choose between the shape of the peak (gaussian, lorentzian, etc.)

- Should we think to add Simpson's rule integration also?
